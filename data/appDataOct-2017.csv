While Lesotho has achieved respectable growth rates in the last few years, poverty remains widespread and unemployment levels are high. The growth fueled by a sharp increase in mining output has not been broad-based as the sector is not labor absorbing and has few forward and backward linkages in the economy. The garment sector employs about 50,000 workers, but prospects for further increases are uncertain given the global liberalization and erosion of preferences. Particular objectives of the growth strategy are to address the most critical constraints facing the private sector to achieve private sector led broad-based growth which is considered to be an essential ingredient for poverty reduction.

There is a critical need to monitor and evaluate what the government has been supporting in terms of activities and initiatives for women's advancement. Despite the significant steps that Jordanian society has taken in the advancement of women in development, and the number of initiatives, activities, and funding that have gone to this issue, little is known about the level of success that has been achieved. Furthermore, indicators on women's empowerment in the area of labor force participation, entrepreneurship and public office are uncharacteristically low given their level of education.  So far, it has not been possible to measure the specific impact of policies, programs and projects on Jordan&apos;s performance in gender equality.

The PDO is to reduce adverse health and environmental impacts in Côte d Ivoire of POPs pesticides by reducing or eliminating their ongoing use and managing existing stockpiles. The PDO will be achieved by strengthening capacity and the regulatory framework for themanagement of pesticides, reducing farmers&apos; dependence on the most problematic pesticides, safeguarding contaminated sites, and managing stockpiles consistent with the country's obligation under the Stockholm Convention. Although the project primarily focuses on POPs pesticides, many activities will have a wider applicability for other classes of pesticides.",http://operationsportal2.worldbank.org/wb/opsportal/ttw/about?projId=P131778,Livelihoods/ CDD,Worker productivity,1,0,Job Quality,Labor Policies

In line with the pre-identifcation mission, the Government and World bank teams discussed and agreed on the following broad areas of focus for the forthcoming project: (i)   Focus on a few priority economic sectors:  The EDRSP has identified 11 priority economic sectors and the project will focus on a sub-set of these.  The target sectors will need to be determined during the preparation of the project and potential criteria that could be used in determining this focus could be: (i) sectors that employ large numbers of the population; (ii) sectors with potential for value addition and improved productivity; and (iii) sectors where foreign direct investment is increasing and/or where significant public finances have been directed. (ii)   Pre-employment and enterprise-based training:  Training provision can be broadly grouped into two categories: (a) Pre-employment training provision; and (b) enterprise-based training provision.  Pre-employment training is targeted towards individuals who are about to enter the labor market and includes training within public and private secondary schools, technical secondary schools, vocational training centers, polytechnics and higher learning institutions.  Enterprise-based training supports individuals already within the labor market with training for the formal wage sector as well as the informal sector.  While these training groups are not mutually exclusive, and several pre-employment training programs promote work-based learning as part of its curricula through apprenticeships and the like, it is helpful to determine whether the focus should be on individuals about to enter the labor market or those already within labor market or a combination of these. This will be decided during preparation. (iii)   Focus on the continuum of skills:  Currently there is an ongoing process to consolidate and enhance the existing specific qualifications frameworks for TVET and Higher Education to enhance student mobility within and among the existing qualifications frameworks and the specific trainings. For instance, there is need to articulate within the TVET and higher education sub-sectors in that someone who completes a course at a TSS, VTC or polytechnic is able to progress on to higher learning institutions. Enhancement of credit accumulation and transfer, recognition and equivalence of degrees, and recognition of prior learning is a priority under the new project.  The project will focus on the development of skills and competencies across occupations (from laborers, technicians and technologists to engineers) within a specific sector.  Interventions that support articulation within the system will be prioritized, such as developing double-qualifying pathways that provide qualifications for work and later education, as well as increasing permeability between different programs to allow young people to keep their options open as long as possible",NA,Skills & Training,Human capital,1,60,Intermediate Outcomes,Labor Policies
